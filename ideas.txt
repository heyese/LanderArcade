Building an .exe:
~/PycharmProjects/LanderArcade
$ python -m nuitka --onefile main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
# Above doesn't seem to work, but with below should just need to zip the directory produced
$ python -m nuitka --standalone main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --include-data-dir=sounds=sounds --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
So far, single file doesn't seem to work when moved to a new directory?

When the shield gets 'trapped', perhaps the simplest thing is to manually
move upwards?  At least, I should think about this problem explicitly
I've done what I thought was a good solution for this, but sometimes now the ship totally disappears into
an object, so it's not good enough


Add an enemy aircraft
Bomb thrower!  Parabolic curves, with bombs exploding on a timer.  Flashing rate can indicate how close it is to exploding
Enemy weapons that temporarily disable the shield
SmartMissileLauncher: missiles that solve equations rather than simply accelerate to the lander's position
Could have a low fuel / low shield warning?

Think better to change to the shield continuous sound - might have changed my mind about this now!
Maybe add a sound for switching shield off?
Add doppler effect for missile engines - and possibly everything, actually
Work on the scores!  Need points for various things


Could have a doppler effect on missiles passing the lander: https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/23583/how-do-i-simulate-the-doppler-effect-in-a-game
I have access to speed - which I think is effectively pitch: https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/media.html
I think the doppler effect idea - whilst very cool - is over ambitious.  I don't think I can alter the speed of
a sound whilst it is actually playing (whereas I can with the volume).  So for missiles that zip past the lander, where
there wouldn't actually be that many repeats in the sound, I don't think it would work.
Actually, I can stop a sound, recording at what point I was at, and start again from that point at a different speed.
Just need to test out whether that works seamlessly or ends up being a mess.
Would be easy to test - just try stopping and starting the existing engine sounds on every update, say.

## Known Bugs
Mountains (but not the furthest away ones, bizarrely) on the minimap appear to glitch slightly when the wrap is done.
I suspect this is unavoidable - I've not found a completely clear way of thinking about it, but I have to pick a point
at which it wraps seamlessly, and I've chosen that so you don't see a glitch in the main camera_view.  To have it also
wrap seamlessly in the minimap (ie. at "WORLD_WDITH - camera_width" and "camera_width") - this is a different point.
(ie. when the lander flips from one side to the other) - this feels right to me.

Explosions go through the terrain - I'm not bothered about this.  Let's call it a feature.
---> Not really a problem, so not intending to "fix"

Still have a bug where sometimes collisions go crazy and the lander disappears somewhere - easy thing to do is not let
y <= 0, but more careful thinking about this will obviously help.  Basically (and roughly), unless there is a terrain
rect underneath the lander, the answer will never be to go further down!
Put in a fix for this, whereby if an object finds itself below y=0, the collision vector being applied is just reversed.
Will see how that behaves ...

The game really, really struggles on my new laptop - such that I don't want to play it.  Initially, I could see
it was running on the integrated graphics chip, but I've fixed that and forced it to run on the GPU.  It still
stutters away - I'm not sure I've got the patience to look into it at this point.  On my years old desktop with a
GTX 1070, it runs really nicely ...

For looped sounds, I've moved to .wav.  MP3 files seem to get a bit of silence at the beginning when encoded.
Still not perfect, but I've just manually made the files a bit bigger by adding in a few manual loops, which makes it
easily good enough (one minor gap every 10 seconds, say, and you'd rarely use the engine for that long).
I've also stopped using my crazy sounds.py function - but instead currently update volume on every loop.
I'm no longer doing any panning - would be nice to add that back in, but I should use the built in pyglet functionality
for that, rather than trying to do it my own way.

A few times my main machine has had a flicker of interruption (malware detection running in the background?  Noticed
network traffic really spiked) and that caused my shield to switch off.  Pretty frustrating.

There's a current bug where an engine sound plays all the time (once it's started).  Should look at and fix this

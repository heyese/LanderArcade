What I've been using to draw my .pngs:

Building an .exe:
~/PycharmProjects/LanderArcade
$ python -m nuitka --onefile main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
# Above doesn't seem to work, but with below should just need to zip the directory produced
$ python -m nuitka --standalone main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
So far, single file doesn't seem to work when moved to a new directory?

When the shield gets 'trapped', perhaps the simplest thing is to manually
move upwards?  At least, I should think about this problem explicitly
I've done what I thought was a good solution for this, but sometimes now the ship totally disappears into
an object, so it's not good enough


Add an enemy aircraft
Have a "super missile launcher"
Bomb thrower!  Parabolic curves, with bombs exploding on a timer.  Flashing rate can indicate how close it is to exploding
Enemy weapons that temporarily disable the shield

Add some sounds!
Need sounds for:
    Explosions - lots of different sounds
    Consider external engines, shields and explosions.  Volume can depend on distance from lander and the pan can depend
    on its position
Think better to change to the shield continuous sound

## Known Bugs
Mountains (but not the furthest away ones, bizarrely) on the minimap appear to glitch slightly when the wrap is done.
I suspect this is unavoidable - I've not found a completely clear way of thinking about it, but I have to pick a point
at which it wraps seamlessly, and I've chosen that so you don't see a glitch in the main camera_view.  To have it also
wrap seamlessly in the minimap (ie. at "WORLD_WDITH - camera_width" and "camera_width") - this is a different point.
(ie. when the lander flips from one side to the other) - this feels right to me.

Explosions go through the terrain - I'm not bothered about this.  Let's call it a feature.

What I've been using to draw my .pngs:

Building an .exe:
~/PycharmProjects/LanderArcade
$ python -m nuitka --onefile main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
# Above doesn't seem to work, but with below should just need to zip the directory produced
$ python -m nuitka --standalone main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
So far, single file doesn't seem to work when moved to a new directory?

When the shield gets 'trapped', perhaps the simplest thing is to manually
move upwards?  At least, I should think about this problem explicitly
I've done what I thought was a good solution for this, but sometimes now the ship totally disappears into
an object, so it's not good enough


Add an enemy aircraft
Have a "super missile launcher"

Add some sounds!

With the parallax code - make sure you can add directly to a parallax level, rather than
having to ensure the clouds are added at the right place!


Sometimes collision detection isn't very good - I sometimes fly through a missile launcher with my shield on
Perhaps it's worth doing my own manual check!?  Just based on distance between centres

Bomb thrower!  Parabolic curves, with bombs exploding on a timer.  Flashing rate can indicate how close it is to exploding

Enemy weapons that temporarily disable the shield

## Known Bugs
Background flicker-glitch at world wrap around point
At terrain edge, seen hostages be placed actually in the terrain and not on top of it

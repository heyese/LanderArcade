What I've been using to draw my .pngs:

Building an .exe:
~/PycharmProjects/LanderArcade
$ python -m nuitka --onefile main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
# Above doesn't seem to work, but with below should just need to zip the directory produced
$ python -m nuitka --standalone main.py --include-data-dir=images=images --windows-icon-from-ico=images/lander.png --disable-console
So far, single file doesn't seem to work when moved to a new directory?

When the shield gets 'trapped', perhaps the simplest thing is to manually
move upwards?  At least, I should think about this problem explicitly
I've done what I thought was a good solution for this, but sometimes now the ship totally disappears into
an object, so it's not good enough


Add an enemy aircraft
Have a "super missile launcher"
Should stars should be on a new parallax layer which is furthest away?
Bomb thrower!  Parabolic curves, with bombs exploding on a timer.  Flashing rate can indicate how close it is to exploding
Enemy weapons that temporarily disable the shield

Add some sounds!

## Known Bugs
Mountains on the minimap do a weird switch, so that when at the left side, on the minimap they are in the wrong places
Think this is because of the mini-map wrap trickery I do with the sprites.
The parallax backgrounds are centred based on the game camera view, which depends on where the lander is.
But I do specific wrapping of the lander in the minimap.
I should try without this - ie. have minimap go from camera_width to WORLD_WIDTH-camera_width

Background flicker-glitch at world wrap around point - fix this
Explosions go through the terrain - I'm not bothered about this.  Let's call it a feature.

    Thank goodness you're here, pilot!
    
    There are a number of hostages, scattered across various different hostile worlds. 
    Each hostage has a special device which provides them with an (EMP-proof) shield and a breathable atmosphere, 
    but they cannot move it and so are stuck where they are on the surface!
    
    We need you to get close enough to each of them so that your transporter can beam them aboard your ship.
    Each world has a secure underground base, accessed via a landing pad - land on the landing pad and any hostages
    on board will be taken to safety.  Once all hostages have been rescued, you can move on to the next world.
    
    Some of these worlds not only have a hostile atmosphere, but also enemies that will fire upon your ship!
    Thankfully, you can attack as well as defend yourself by using your trusty shield!  
    You can also carry a single EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) charge which will disable any active shields and 
    engines it touches for a while - but ensure that when fired your own shield and engine aren't activated!
    
    You can land on the landing pad before you have rescued all the hostages - the base will immediately refill
    your fuel, recharge your shield and reload the EMP charge.  Keep an eye on your fuel and shield levels - 
    on different missions, your ship may have different capacities for these vital resources.  Also, some worlds 
    have a stronger gravitational pull than others, so you may find you burn through your fuel quickly.
    
    LANDING
    The landing pads have a status light that activates when you get close, indicating whether or not it is safe 
    enough to land.  A red status indicates your ship is over the edge, moving too quickly or too tilted - touch 
    the pad and you will crash and burn ...  A green status indicates your descent is looking good.
    The ship will provide a helpful visual indicator, showing the angular range you need to keep within for a 
    successful landing.
    
    Your first mission will simply be a landing practice with no hostages to rescue.
    We have faith in you, pilot!

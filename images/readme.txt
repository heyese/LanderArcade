Want objects to take the shortest path to the lander.
So instead of facing the lander, they should face the closest of three points - lander coords,
lander coords - world width, lander coords + world width
Also, make sure, like the lander, that they do wrap around!!

should use spatial hashing on ground enemies

Screen should shudder on impacts to the lander
